For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 2. 

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> According to a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
group (Spanish vs. Moroccan) as a between-subjects factor and temporal focus (past vs. future) as a within-subjectS factor, temporal focus differed significantly between
Spaniards and Moroccans, as indicated by a significant
interaction of temporal focus and group, F(1, 78) = 19.12,
p = .001, ηp2 = .20 (Fig. 2). Moroccans showed greater
agreement with past-focused statements than Spaniards
did, t(78) = 4.04, p = .001, and Spaniards showed greater
agreement with future-focused statements than Moroccans
did, t(78) = −3.32, p = .001.
